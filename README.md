# PMSM Motor Monitoring System  
A system for analysis and monitoring of PMSM motor operation using WCF services, file manipulation, data streaming, and event-driven processing.

## Project Overview  
This project implements an integrated monitoring solution for a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) using a real dataset (from the University of Paderborn).  
The application provides anomaly detection, real-time visualization of key motor parameters, warning/event notifications, and structured data processing through a WCF service.

The project unifies key C# concepts:  
- WCF service hosting and communication  
- Dispose pattern and resource management  
- File & directory manipulation  
- Stream-based data transfer  
- Delegates and events  
- Real-time analytics and anomaly detection  

Dataset:  
**Electric Motor Temperature Dataset (Kaggle)**
